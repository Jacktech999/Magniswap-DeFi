## What is MagniSwap?

MagniSwap is a revolutionary DeFi platform that brings the power of Norse God Magni to the cryptocurrency world. Our mission is to deliver cryptocurrency solutions that enhance the growth and availability of crypto use cases while addressing lingering problems in the cryptocurrency and DeFi space. We are committed to building an engaging community based on openness and trust to make a positive impact on the world.

## Vision and Mission

Our vision is to build a robust crypto community that allows members to participate in the decision-making process. We grant holders and community members access to staking, farming, and swap functions using their MAGNI token.

## MagniSwap’s Utilities

### Token Swapping

MagniSwap utilizes secure smart contracts to provide automated market makers (AMM) with liquidity, allowing users to swap their favorite cryptocurrencies for $MAGNI. We accept all major crypto and fiat currencies including BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, and BUSD. As a BEP-20 token, MagniSwap users will benefit from the quick and low-cost fees of the BNB Smart Chain network.

### Token Staking

Our staking feature is based on the proof of stake (PoS) algorithm, serving the blockchain network and rewarding users with stakes. Staking allows users to participate in formulating the price of the token. Users can claim their rewards periodically or automatically, depending on their choice.

### Token Farming

Yield farming is possible with MagniSwap tokens when holders participate in single or dual-token farming pools. Opportunities include:

- Yield in MAGNI token.
- Yield from the liquidity pool the user is participating in.
- Yield from the appreciation/depreciation in the MAGNI token.
